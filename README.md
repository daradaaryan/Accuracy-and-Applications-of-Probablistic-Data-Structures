There are many Data Structures that we come across from stacks, queues, heaps to sets and
hashmaps. The applications in which they are used are immense and quite useful for various
problems in not only computer science but in real life as well. In this project we are working on
the implementation of various advanced data structures such as Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog
and Bloom Filter. These are also called probabilistic or randomized data structures. We have
studied various aspects of probability and statistics and now we are going to check the statistical
accuracy of these data structures with respect to the space of data used.
